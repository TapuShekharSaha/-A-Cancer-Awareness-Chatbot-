# -A-Cancer-Awareness-Chatbot-
Women are society's fundamental constituents. Any developing nation should prioritize improving the health of its women. These days, various forms of cancer in women represent a serious threat to the advancement of society. This occurs because women are not well-informed about the illness. A viable way to fulfill this function in the digital age is a chatbot. Understanding the user's question is the main obstacle to a successful chatbot implementation. Most Indian women ask the chatbot insufficient or incomplete questions because of their low literacy skills. Because the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model misunderstood the questions, they were unable to obtain the correct responses. Our goal in this work is to present an Explainable AI and LLMbased chatbot that effectively creates comprehensive queries from input queries. To build the model for this study, we took into account XL-Net, SHAP, and Integrated Gradients. Incomplete or insufficient survey questions have been gathered in order to poll Adamas University students. The accuracy achieved by the suggested model is 94.95\%, which is deemed acceptable by the community.
